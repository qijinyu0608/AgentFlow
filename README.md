AgentMesh is a **Multi-Agent platform** for AI agents building, providing a framework for inter-agent communication,
task planning, and autonomous decision-making. Build your agent team quickly and solve complex tasks through agent
collaboration.

## Overview

AgentMesh uses a modular layered design for flexible and extensible multi-agent systems:

- **Agent Collaboration**: Support for role definition, task allocation, and multi-turn autonomous decision-making.
  Communication protocol for remote heterogeneous agents coming soon.
- **Multi-Modal Models**: Seamless integration with OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, and other leading LLMs through a unified
  API.
- **Extensible Tools**: Built-in search engines, browser automation, file system access, and terminal tools. MCP
  protocol support coming soon for even more tool extensions.
- **Multi-Platform**: Run via CLI, Docker, or SDK. WebUI and integration with common software coming soon.

## Quick Start

Choose one of these three ways to build and run your agent team:

### 1. Terminal

Run a multi-agent team from your command line:

#### 1.1 Installation

**Requirements:** Linux, MacOS, or Windows with Python installed.

> Python 3.11+ recommended (especially for browser tools), at least python 3.7+ required.
> Download from: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Clone the repo and navigate to the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MinimalFuture/AgentMesh
cd AgentMesh
```

Install core dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For browser tools, install additional dependencies (python3.11+ required):

```bash
pip install browser-use==0.1.40
playwright install
```

#### 1.2 Configuration

Edit the `config.yaml` file with your model settings and agent configurations:

```bash
cp config-template.yaml config.yaml
```

By default, runtime SQLite databases live under `data/sqlite/`, and migration backups are stored under `data/backups/`.

Add your model `api_key` - AgentMesh supports `openai`, `claude`, `deepseek`, `qwen`, and others.

> The template includes two examples:
> - `general_team`: A general-purpose agent for search and research tasks.
> - `software_team`: A development team with three roles that collaborates on web applications.
>
> You can add your own custom teams, and customize models, tools, skills, and system prompts for each agent.

#### 1.2.1 Skills

AgentMesh now supports lightweight `skill` packages. A skill is a reusable bundle of prompt guidance plus default tools.

The root `config.yaml` can declare skill search paths:

```yaml
skills:
  paths:
    - agentmesh/skills
```

Each agent can then reference one or more skills:

```yaml
teams:
  general_team:
    agents:
      - name: General Agent
        system_prompt: You are a versatile assistant.
        skills:
          - researcher
          - writer
```

Each built-in skill lives under `agentmesh/skills/<skill_name>/skill.yaml`:

```yaml
name: researcher
description: Structured research and evidence-oriented analysis skill.
prompt: |
  Focus on gathering reliable facts before drafting conclusions.
tools:
  - google_search
  - read
```

At runtime, AgentMesh will append the skill prompt to the agent's `system_prompt` and merge the skill's tools into the agent tool list.

#### 1.3 Execution

You can run tasks directly using command-line arguments, specifying the team with `-t` and your question with `-q`:

```bash
python3 main.py -t general_team -q "analyze the trends in multi-agent technology"
python3 main.py -t software_team -q "develop a simple trial booking page for AgentMesh multi-agent platform"
```

Alternatively, enter interactive mode for multi-turn conversations:

```bash
python3 main.py -l                               # List available agent teams
python3 main.py -t software_team                 # Run the 'software_team'
```

### 2. Docker

Download the docker-compose configuration file:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MinimalFuture/AgentMesh/main/docker-compose.yml
```

Download the configuration template and add your model API keys (see section 1.2 for configuration details):

```bash
curl -o config.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MinimalFuture/AgentMesh/main/config-template.yaml
```

Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm agentmesh bash
```

Once the container starts, you'll enter the command line. The usage is the same as in section 1.3 - specify a team to
start the interactive mode:

```bash
python3 main.py -l                               # List available agent teams
python3 main.py -t general_team                  # Start multi-turn conversation with the specified team
```

### 3. SDK

Use the AgentMesh SDK to build custom agent teams programmatically:

```bash
pip install agentmesh-sdk
```

#### 3.1 Single Agent

Run a single super-agent directly without a team, with multi-turn conversation support:

```python
from agentmesh import Agent, LLMModel
from agentmesh.tools import *

# Initialize model
model = LLMModel(model="gpt-4.1", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Create a single agent with tools
agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    description="A versatile assistant",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant who answers questions using available tools.",
    model=model,
    tools=[GoogleSearch(), Calculator()]
)

# Single-turn call
response = agent.run_stream("What are the latest trends in multi-agent AI?")

# Multi-turn conversation (history is retained automatically)
agent.run_stream("My project is named AgentMesh")
agent.run_stream("Write a brief intro for my project")  # Remembers the project name
```

#### 3.2 Agent Team

Build a multi-agent team where agents collaborate on complex tasks (replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key):

```python
from agentmesh import AgentTeam, Agent, LLMModel
from agentmesh.tools import *

# Initialize model
model = LLMModel(model="gpt-4.1", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Create team and add agents
team = AgentTeam(name="software_team", description="A software development team", model=model)

team.add(Agent(name="PM", description="Handles product requirements",
               system_prompt="You are an experienced PM who creates clear, comprehensive PRDs"))

team.add(Agent(name="Developer", description="Implements code based on requirements", model=model,
               system_prompt="You write clean, efficient, maintainable code following requirements precisely",
               tools=[Calculator(), GoogleSearch()]))

# Execute task
result = team.run(task="Write a Snake client game")
```

### 4. Web Service

Coming soon
